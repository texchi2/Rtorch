Dear Dr. Fatima,

We are writing to propose three communication strategies with the potential to improve womenâ€™s participation in cervical cancer screening in Somaliland:

1. **In-person communication and information material at health centers:** Health centers can provide in-person communication and information material to women visiting the center. This can include brochures, posters, **A4 notes from HGH HIS at OPD**, and other informational materials that explain the importance of cervical cancer screening and how to get screened.

2. Verbal communication through seminars and workshops: Seminars and workshops can be organized to educate women about their risk of cancer and the importance of screening. These events can be held in community centers, schools, or other public spaces and can be led by healthcare professionals such as **Jessica from Taiwan Technique Mission**.

3. **Better recall through SMS (Telesom or Somtel) written in Somali languages:** A system can be set up to send reminders to women through SMS written in their native language. These reminders can include information about when their next screening is due and how to schedule an appointment.

4. **Offering breast ultrasound and pap smear together during a screening campaign** can provide women with the opportunity to have two important health screenings at the same time. This can be more convenient for women and may encourage them to attend the screening. Additionally, offering multiple screenings together can help to raise awareness about the importance of regular health check-ups and preventative care.

These strategies aim to increase awareness about cervical cancer screening and its importance among women in Somaliland. By providing information through multiple channels and in a culturally sensitive manner, we hope to improve women's participation in cervical cancer screening.

Thank you for considering our proposal.

Sincerely,
Dr. Tex, Dr. Omar, and Dr. Dave
