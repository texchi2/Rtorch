Dear Dr. Fatima,

We are writing to propose three communication strategies with the potential to improve womenâ€™s participation in cervical cancer screening in Somaliland:

1. **In-person communication and information material at Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH):** This can include brochures, posters, **A5-sized notes from HGH HIS at OPD**, and other informational materials that explain the importance of cervical cancer screening and how to get screened. It is also important to **involve husbands in the conversation** about cervical cancer screening as their support can play a crucial role in encouraging women to attend screenings.

2. **Better recall through SMS (Telesom or Somtel) written in Somali languages:** A system can be set up to send reminders to women through SMS. These reminders can include information about ***how to attend a screening***, recall for ***further therapy in case with abnormal findings*** of pap smear, and when their ***next screening*** is due. We could also promote the event on social media platforms, displaying large posters in public spaces, running radio or television advertisements, using **word-of-mouth promotion** through community organizations or religious groups.

3. **Incentives:** People can be encouraged to attend screenings through free health checks, small gifts (like multivitamin tablets), recognition, or small rewards.

4. **Offering breast ultrasound and pap smear together during a screening campaign** can provide women with the opportunity to have two important health screenings at the same time. This can be more convenient for women and may encourage them to attend the screening. Additionally, offering multiple screenings together can help to raise awareness about the importance of regular health check-ups and preventative care.

<!--4. **Patient recall:** Implementing a system for recalling patients who have undergone a pap smear test with abnormal findings can help to ensure that they receive appropriate follow-up care and therapy.-->

5. Verbal communication through seminars and workshops: Seminars and workshops can be organized to educate women about their risk of cancer and the importance of screening. These events can be held in community centers, schools, or other public spaces and can be led by healthcare professionals such as *Jessica from Taiwan Technique Mission*.


These strategies aim to increase awareness about health check-ups and its importance among women in Somaliland. By providing information through multiple channels and in a culturally sensitive manner, we hope to improve women's participation in screening campaign.

Thank you for considering our proposal.

Sincerely,


Dr. Tex, Dr. Omar, and Dr. Dave (7th June 2023)
