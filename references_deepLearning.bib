	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Turnaround time (TAT) is an important indicator of laboratory performance. It is often difficult to achieve fast TAT for blood tests conducted at clinics in developing countries. This is because clinics where the patient is treated are often far away from the laboratory, and transporting blood samples and test results between the two locations creates significant delay. Recent efforts have sought to mitigate this problem by using Short Message Service (SMS) to reduce TAT. Studies reporting the impact of this technique have not been published in scientific literature however. In this paper we present a study of LabPush, a system developed to test whether SMS delivery of HIV related laboratory results to clinics could shorten TAT time significantly. METHOD: LapPush was implemented in six clinics of the Kingdom of Swaziland. SMS results were sent out from the laboratory as a supplement to normal transport of paper results. Each clinic was equipped with a mobile phone to receive SMS results. The laboratory that processes the blood tests was equipped with a system for digital input of results, and transmission of results via SMS to the clinics. RESULTS: Laboratory results were received for 1041 different clinical cases. The total number of SMS records received (1032) was higher than that of paper records (965), indicating a higher loss rate for paper records. A statistical comparison of TAT for SMS and paper reports indicates a statistically significant improvement for SMS. Results were more positive for more rural clinics, and an urban clinic with high workload. CONCLUSION: SMS can be used to reduce TAT for blood tests taken at clinics in developing countries. Benefits are likely to be greater at clinics that are further away from laboratories, due to the difficulties this imposes on transport of paper records.},

Physical examination disclosed a nontender mass in the right maxillary mucobuccal fold and the magnetic resonance imaging revealed a solid mass occupied in the right maxillary sinus. Enucleation combined with peripheral ostectomy was performed. Histologic examination of the excised lesion showed ameloblastic carcinoma. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was carried out.

METHODS: A serologic survey and risk factors associated T. gondii infection among PSC in the DRSTP was assessed by the latex agglutination (LA) test and a questionnaire interview including parents' occupation, various uncomfortable symptoms, histories of eating raw or undercooked food, drinking unboiled water, and raising pets, was conducted in October 2010. Schoolchildren from 4 primary schools located in the capital areas were selected, in total 255 serum samples were obtained by venipuncture, of which 123 serum samples were obtained from boys (9.8 +/- 1.4 yrs) and 132 serum samples were obtained from girls (9.7 +/- 1.3 yrs). RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was 63.1\% (161/255). No significant gender difference in seroprevalence was found between boys (62.6\%, 77/123) and girls (63.6\%, 84/132) (p = 0.9). The older age group of 10 years had insignificantly higher seroprevalence (69.9\%, 58/83) than that of the younger age group of 8 year olds (67.7\%, 21/31) (p = 0.8). It was noteworthy that the majority of seropositive PSC (75.8\%, 122/161) had high LA titers of {\textgreater}/=1: 1024, indirectly indicating acute or repeated Toxoplasma infection. Parents whose jobs were non-skilled workers (73.1\%) showed significantly higher seroprevalence than that of semiskilled- (53.9\%) or skilled workers (48.8\%) (p {\textless} 0.05). Children who had a history of raising cats also showed significantly higher seroprevalence than those who did not (p {\textless} 0.001).Children who claimed to have had recent ocular manifestation or headache, i.e. within 1 month, seemed to have insignificantly higher seroprevalence than those who did not (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' educational level and cats kept indoors seemed to be the high risk factors for PSC in acquisition of T. gondii infection. While, ocular manifestation and/or headache of PSC should be checked for the possibility of being T. gondii elicited. Measures such as improving environmental hygiene and intensive educational intervention to both PSC and their parents should be performed immediately so as to reduce T. gondii infection of DRSTP inhabitants including PSC and adults.},

	abstract = {The Democratic Republic of Sao Tome e Principe (DRSTP) consists of the two islands of Sao Tome and Principe and a number of smaller islets in the Gulf of Guinea. Sao Tome lies approximately 180 miles from Gabon on the West African coast, and the equator crosses its southern tip. The climate is tropical with two rainy seasons. The total number of inhabitants in the DRSTP is estimated to be 160,000. Due to the suitable climate, many neglected tropical parasitic diseases e.g., intestinal parasites, Schistosoma intercalatum, and Toxoplasma gondii have been found endemic in DRSTP [1,2]. Since arthropodborne parasitic diseases e.g., falciparum malaria has been long seriously endemic, the infection rate of malaria has been greatly reduced from 25\% in year of 2000 to less than 3\% in year of 2008 in DRSTP through intensive insecticide spray; and that the achievement was accomplished by the efforts of Taiwanese experts who were financially supported by Taiwan government [3-5]. Nevertheless, Lymphatic Elephantiasis (LE) cases can be still found in some inhabitants (Figure 1) who have been living in Sao Tome Island for more than 25 years; whereas LE was ignored and overshadowed by malaria for a long time in DRSTP. Although Ruiz et al. [6] has indicated such elephantiasis in STP people is possibly produced by deposits of inorganic materials in the lymph node of the lower extremities which is alternatively named of Podoconiosis; it is evidenced that in fact filarial lymphatic elephantiasis (FLE) co-exists with Podoconiosis in DRSTP because we found one FLE case in STP reporter who has filarial dance sign [7] in left inguinal region as detected by Ultrasonography with a linear array transducer at 7.5 MHz (Sonoma Health Products, Inc., CA, USA) (Figure 2). Comprehensive epidemiological investigations for STP inhabitants are urgently needed to elucidate whether FLE is commonly transmitted among rural areas. Although FLE has been regarded by World Health Organization as important Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD); until 2011, WHO designated podoconiosis as one of the 20 NTDs [8]. Since the different infection routes for Podoconiosis and FLE, measures against Podoconiosis is to prevent inhabitants walking on the soil with bare feet from the skin being penetrated by inorganic materials derived from alkaline volcanic rock; while measures against FLE including avoid mosquito’s biting and take Albendazole regularly.},

However, it remains undetermined which of these markers plays the most important role and may be the most useful indicator to stratify the patients by risk. METHODS: We determined the individual prognostic value of these 6 markers by analyzing a derivation cohort with 98 non-small cell lung cancer patients by immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between the IHC expression levels of these markers and disease prognosis was investigated, and an immunohistochemical panel for prognostic prediction was subsequently generated through prognostic model analysis. The value of the immunohistochemical panel was then verified by a validation cohort with 91 lung cancer patients. RESULTS: In derivation cohort, PAI-2 is the most powerful prognostic factor (HR = 2.30; P = 0.001), followed by MMP-9 (HR = 2.09; P = 0.019) according to multivariate analysis. When combining PAI-2 and MMP-9, the most unfavorable prognostic group (low PAI-2 and high MMP-9 IHC expression levels) showed a 6.40-fold increased risk of a poor prognosis compared to the most favorable prognostic group (high PAI-2 and low MMP-9 IHC expression levels). PAI-2 and MMP-9 IHC panel could more precisely identify high risk patients in both derivation and validation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed PAI-2 as the most powerful prognostic marker among PA and MMP protease family even after considering their close relationships with each other. By utilizing a combination of PAI-2 and MMP-9, more precise prognostic information than merely using pathological stage alone can be obtained for lung cancer patients.},

	abstract = {©2016 AACR. Epigenetic correlates of the head and neck cancer may illuminate its pathogenic roots. Through a gene set enrichment analysis, we found that the oncogenic transcription factor RUNX2 is widely upregulated in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with lymph node metastasis, where it also predicts poor prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Enforced expression of ectopic RUNX2 promoted the metastatic capabilities of HNSCC, whereas RUNX2 silencing inhibited these features. Mechanistic investigations showed that manipulating levels of activin A (INHBA) could rescue or compromise the RUNX2-mediated metastatic capabilities of HNSCC cells. Furthermore, we found that miR-376c-3p encoded within the 3′-untranslated region of RUNX2 played a pivotal role in regulating RUNX2 expression in highly metastatic HNSCC cells, where it was downregulated commonly. Restoring miR-376c expression in this setting suppressed expression of RUNX2/INHBA axis along with metastatic capability. Clinically, we observed an inverse relationship between miR-376c-3p expression and the RUNX2/INHBA axis in HNSCC specimens. In summary, our results defined a novel pathway in which dysregulation of the RUNX2/INHBA axis due to miR-376c downregulation fosters lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.},

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in extracellular matrix remodelling; they are usually found to significantly increase during cancer progression, and these increases may lead to poor patient survival. In this study, we produced a biosensor that can be recognized by MMP2 and then be unravelled by the attached quencher to emit visible light. We used 3.5-nm gold nanoparticles as a quencher that absorbed emission from UCNPs at a wavelength of 540 nm. The biosensor consists of an upconversion nanoparticle, MMP2-recognized polypeptides and quenchers. Here, UCNPs consisting of NaYF4:Yb(3+)/Er(3+) were prepared via a high temperature co-precipitation method while protecting the oleic acid ligand. To improve the biocompatibility and modify the UCNPs with a polypeptide, they were coated with a silica shell and further conjugated with MMP-recognizing polypeptides. The polypeptide has two ends of featuring carboxylic and thiol groups that react with UCNPs and AuNPs, and the resulting nanoparticles were referred to as UCNP@p-Au. According to the in vitro cell viability analysis, UCNP@p-Au exhibited little toxicity and biocompatibility in head and neck cancer cells. Cellular uptake studies showed that the MMP-based biosensor was activated by 980-nm irradiation to emit green light.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.},

Objective: In this study, we seek to assess factors facilitating as well as factors hindering the adoption of mobile devices in the Swazi healthcare through evaluating the end-users of the LabPush system. Methods: A qualitative study with semi-structured and in-depth one on one interviews were conducted over two month period July-August 2012. Purposive sampling was used; participants were those operating and using the LabPush system at the remote clinics, at the national laboratory and the supervisors of users at Swaziland. Interview questions were focused on perceived of ease of use and usefulness of the system. All interviews were recorded and then transcribed. Results: This study had aimed its primary focus on reducing TAT, prompt patient care, reducing bouncing of patients and defaulting of patients which were challenges that the clinicians have always had. Therefore, the results revealed several barriers and facilitators to the adoption of mobile device by healthcare providers in the Swaziland. The themes Shortens TAT, Technical support, Patient-centered care, Mindset, Improved communication, Missing Reports, Workload, Workflow, Security of smart phone, Human error and Ownership are sorted by facilitators to barriers.

Our results showed a number of proteins found to be over- expressed in HNSCC. We identified thymosin beta-4 X-linked (TMSB4X) is one of the most significant candidate biomarkers. Higher TMSB4X expression in the tumor was found by N/T-paired HNSCC samples at both RNA and protein level. Overexpression of TMSB4X was found significantly associated with poor prognosis of overall survival (OS, P = 0.006) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.013) in HNSCC patients. Silencing of TMSB4X expression in HNSCC cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro, as well as inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. Altogether, our global proteomics analysis identified that TMSB4X is a newly discovered biomarker in HNSCC whose functions resulted in enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

	abstract = {Background: The survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In order to utilize a continuous gene expression for survival analysis, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point by the dichotomization of the patients. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, those predetermined cutoffs by software usually set at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) value to find a significant P-value of the Kaplan-Meier curve. There are few clinicopathological features available on their pre-processed data sets. Methods: We developed a comprehensive workflow by R script, running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker discovery. Results: Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500) programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders, we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient survival. According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni adjusted P-value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard ratio (\&amp;gt;=1.5), there were ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, which are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of overall survival (OS). At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients (with hazard ratio \&amp;lt;=0.5), named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB. Further validations are warranted.Conclusions: We suggested this analysis tool equipped with an optimal cutoff finder will help with biomarker discovery of protein-coding genes, in terms of tumor-agnostic therapy.},

              Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of liver cancer, and assessing its histopathological grade requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, the histopathological H\&E images from the Genomic Data Commons Databases were used to train a neural network (inception V3) for automatic classification. According to the evaluation of our model by the Matthews correlation coefficient, the performance level was close to the ability of a 5-year experience pathologist, with 96.0\% accuracy for benign and malignant classification, and 89.6\% accuracy for well, moderate, and poor tumor differentiation. Furthermore, the model was trained to predict the ten most common and prognostic mutated genes in HCC. We found that four of them, including
              CTNNB1
              ,
              FMN2

              , could be predicted from histopathology images, with external AUCs from 0.71 to 0.89. The findings demonstrated that convolutional neural networks could be used to assist pathologists in the classification and detection of gene mutation in liver cancer.},

            The adoption of digital pathology has enabled the curation of large repositories of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). Computationally identifying WSIs with similar morphologic features within large repositories without requiring supervised training can have significant applications. However, the retrieval speeds of algorithms for searching similar WSIs often scale with the repository size, which limits their clinical and research potential. Here we show that self-supervised deep learning can be leveraged to search for and retrieve WSIs at speeds that are independent of repository size. The algorithm, which we named SISH (for self-supervised image search for histology) and provide as an open-source package, requires only slide-level annotations for training, encodes WSIs into meaningful discrete latent representations and leverages a tree data structure for fast searching followed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm for WSI retrieval. We evaluated SISH on multiple tasks (including retrieval tasks based on tissue-patch queries) and on datasets spanning over 22,000 patient cases and 56 disease subtypes. SISH can also be used to aid the diagnosis of rare cancer types for which the number of available WSIs is often insufficient to train supervised deep-learning models.},

This study investigated the effects of an extract of khat on primary  normal human oral keratinocytes (NOK) and normal human oral fibroblasts (NOF).  Low (sublethal) concentrations of khat inhibited the proliferation of both cell  types in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Both NOK and NOF treated  with khat accumulated in the G1-phase of the cell cycle and showed increased  expression of the stress-sensitive p53 protein after 24 h. Normal human oral  keratinocytes showed a profound increase in p16(INK4A) (p16) after 24 h and  showed morphological changes suggesting cell differentiation. Normal human oral  fibroblasts showed growth inhibition and increased expression of p21(WAF1/CIP1)  (p21) within 24 h. The concentrations of khat tested in this study were within  the range of those found in the oral cavity of khat chewers. The results show  that stress induced by khat modulates the cell cycle in oral keratinocytes and  fibroblasts. It is further speculated whether khat could have similar effects in  vivo, especially in keratinocytes.},

This study  further investigates the more specific role played by mitochondria in  khat-induced cell death and the kinetics of the events involved in this process.  Exposure of primary normal human oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts to khat  extract resulted in a swift and sustained decrease of the mitochondrial inner  transmembrane potential occurring within 0.5-1h. Loss of mitochondrial membrane  potential preceded all other biochemical and morphologic changes, and was  associated with a significant decrease in cell survival. Subsequently,  apoptosis-inducing factor was released from mitochondria into cytosol and  relocated to nucleus. Cyclosporine A and bongkrekic acid delayed both the loss of  mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential and the onset of cell death. This  study describes a novel mechanism of khat-induced cell death in primary normal  oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts involving an early pivotal effect on  mitochondrial function and integrity.},

METHODS:  Survey of head and neck cancer experts and extensive literature review and  classification of levels of evidence for published data. RESULTS: Extensive data  demonstrating the level of published literature support for or against many  compounds and behaviours are presented. In several cases, there was good  correlation between expert opinions and literature support, whereas for others,  there was a clear discordance. CONCLUSION: Experts in oral cancer are in  agreement that tobacco smoking and betel use are significant risk factors for the  development of oral cavity carcinoma. There is a lack of agreement about the  risks of alcohol, poor-fitting dentures, maté tea, and a diet low in fruits and  vegetables. Sufficient data have been published demonstrating the risk associated  with each factor; however, it appears that the most current data and research are  not as available to medical professionals as they should be. The perceived risks  of tobacco chewing and use of khat were not substantiated by a solid foundation  of data. A higher degree of concordance among experts was found for riskier  health habits such as tobacco, alcohol, and betel chewing, whereas the votes were  more dispersed for the risk factors that received lower ratings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study is the first of its kind to be conducted in Saudi Arabia (KSA), aiming to analyze the effectiveness of an intervention program in  improving the knowledge of oral cancer among the youth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  total of 1,051 young Saudis (57\% males and 43\% females with a mean age of 20.4 ±  1.98) were selected using multi-stage cluster sampling. Knowledge assessment was  accomplished using a closed-ended questionnaire which was subjected to  reliability tests. Prevalence of risk factors in relation to gender was analyzed  using the chi-squared test. Effectiveness was calculated by comparing the pre-  and post-intervention means, using the two-tailed paired t-test. Multiple  logistic regression was employed in order to determine factors associated with  awareness of risk habits, signs/symptoms and prevention of oral cancer. The  significance level in this study was set at 0.05. RESULTS: Females were seen to  be more into the habit of sheesha smoking (3.3\% rather than the use of other  forms of risk factors. Prevalence of diverse risk factors such as cigarette  smoking (20\%), sheesha (15.3\%), khat (27\%) and shamma (9\%) was seen among males.  Gender and the use of modifiable risk factors among the study sample were  significantly (p{\textless}0.001) associated with effectiveness of the intervention. The  intervention program was highly effective (p{\textless}0.001) in improving the knowledge of  oral cancer among the youth in Jazan, KSA. Multivariate analysis revealed that  age and gender are the most significant factors affecting knowledge. CONCLUSIONS:  The study gives a direction for further public health initiatives in this oral  cancer prone region.},

This study describes a novel cytotoxic effect of whole khat  extract on three leukemia cell lines. Cells were exposed to khat extract and  harvested for analysis by fluorescent and electron microscopy, trypan blue  exclusion, as well as immunoblotting to characterize the mode of cell death. In a  separate series, cells were pretreated with a panel of caspase inhibitors for  possible inhibitory effects. Khat induced a rapid cell death effect in HL-60,  Jurkat, and NB4 cells that occurred within 2 h of exposure. The treated cells  retained their ability to exclude trypan blue dye, a key feature in the apoptotic  process. Exposed cells consistently developed morphological features of manifest  apoptosis. Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, completely inhibited toxic activity  for up to 8 h, with partial inhibition by other caspase-specific agents. Western  blot analysis showed specific cleavage of caspase-3 in khat-exposed cells. This  study shows that khat induces cell death by apoptosis in a process sensitive to  inhibition by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that subcellular interactions could  be of particular relevance for the biological effects of khat in the cell death  process and possibly carcinogenesis.},

This study investigated the mechanism of khat-induced cytotoxicity using  primary normal human oral keratinocytes (NOK) and fibroblasts (NOF). Khat induced  rounding up of cells, plasma membrane blebbing, and condensation of nuclear  chromatin within 3-6 h of exposure. The cells also showed externalization of  phosphatidylserine and fragmentation of DNA. Morphological and biochemical  features were compatible with cell death by apoptosis. Khat also induced an  increase in cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a depletion of  intracellular glutathione (GSH) within 1 h of exposure. Antioxidants reduced ROS  generation, GSH depletion and delayed the onset of cytotoxicity in both cell  types. Generally, NOF cells were more sensitive to khat-induced cytotoxicity than  NOK cells. These effects were elicited at concentrations of khat expected to  occur in the oral cavity during khat chewing. In summary, khat induced apoptotic  cell death in primary normal oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts by an early  effect on mechanisms that regulate oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Khat (Catha edulis) is a shrub or tree whose leaves have been chewed for centuries by people who live in the Eastern part of Africa and the Arabian  Peninsula. It has recently turned up in North America and Europe, particularly  among emigrants and refugees from countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen.  Khat contains a number of chemicals, among which are two controlled substances,  cathinone (Schedule I) and cathine (Schedule IV). Both chemicals are stimulant  drugs with effects similar to amphetamine. Chewing the leaves makes people feel  more alert and talkative, and suppresses appetite. Chewing khat leaves releases  cathinone, a stimulant that produces the feeling of euphoria. When cathinone is  broken down in the body, it produces chemicals including cathine and  norephedrine, which have a similar structure to amphetamine and adrenaline  (epinephrine). Regular khat use is associated with a rise in arterial blood  pressure and pulse rate, corresponding with levels of cathinone in the plasma.  Moreover, regular khat chewers have gingivitis and loose teeth, but there appears  to be no convincing unusual incidence of oral cancer. Among khat users in Yemen  there is, however, a higher incidence of esophageal cancer compared with gastric  cancer. Long term use or abuse can cause insomnia, anorexia, gastric disorders,  depression, liver damage and cardiac complications, including myocardial  infarction. Manic and delusional behavior, violence, suicidal depression,  hallucinations, paranoia and khat-induced psychosis have also been reported. On  the basis of the scientific data it seems clear that khat use has negative  consequences on the economic development of a country and on the health of the  society.},

Khat decreased  cell proliferation, epithelial thickness, and cytokeratin 13 expression, while  inducing premature expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1), transglutaminases, involucrin,  and filaggrin. This suggests that khat is able to induce abnormal differentiation  of the buccal epithelium. Khat-induced alterations were accompanied by increased  levels of p38 and were reversed by p38 inhibition, pointing to p38 as the key  player in this process. The morphological changes described herein mirror the in  vivo changes previously described in khat users, and demonstrate for the first  time that khat induces pathological alterations in human buccal mucosa, providing  evidence that raises concerns about the effects of khat use on oral health.},

METHODS: The present cross-sectional study included 1052 dental  patients aged 15 years and older. A detailed oral examination was performed by a  single examiner in accordance with standard international criteria. RESULTS:  Overall, 25.2\% of the study participants presented with one or more white  lesions. The most prevalent lesions were khat-induced white lesion (8.8\%),  leukoedema (5.1\%), and frictional keratosis (3.9\%). Potentially malignant  lesions, such as lichen planus, leukoplakia, and smokeless tobacco-induced  lesions, were seen in 2.4\%, 1.2\%, and 1.7\% of participants, respectively.  Moreover, three cases of oral cancer were identified. The presence of white  lesions was found to be significantly associated with advanced age (P = .004),  male gender (P = .009), and khat/tobacco chewing habits (P {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS:  The present study demonstrates a high prevalence of oral benign and potentially  malignant white lesions.

	abstract = {Khat (Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl.) is an evergreen flowering shrub used as a stimulant in many regions worldwide including East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula,  Europe, and the United States. Chewing leaves of khat induces excitement and  euphoria, which are primarily attributed to two major constituents, cathinone and  cathine. Khat also contains other important constituents such as cathedulins. A  considerable number of studies reported side effects induced by the khat extracts  to both embryos and adults. These include teratogenicity and developmental  retardation, oral cancer and ulcers, high blood pressure, and myocardial  infarction. So far, little attention has been paid to the effects of khat  extracts on the molecular signaling interactions. We aimed in this study to  investigate this through evaluating the effects of khat extracts on SKOV3, a  human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line. We show, by in vitro assays, that khat  induces several cellular defects including reduced cell size, cell membrane  damage, and apoptosis. At high khat extract concentrations, the cell metabolic  activity, cell cycle, and cellular proliferation were affected. RT-qPCR analysis  showed an increase in the gene expression of the apoptotic marker BAX, the tumor  suppressor p53, and the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Protein expression analysis  by immunostaining showed downregulation of β-catenin, E-cadherin, and Ki-67 and  upregulation of FZD8 and SPRY2, suggesting that Wnt and FGF signaling were  implicated. SwissTargetPrediction in silico analysis showed that khat  constituents cathine, cathinone, catheduline K2, and catheduline E5 bind to  family A G-protein-coupled receptor, cause many neurological diseases and  disorders such as Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, and induce  many ovarian cancer-related diseases. The analysis also showed that important  signaling pathways such as CREB, Wnt, FGF, IL-6, and ERK/MAPK, and that of the  endometrial cancer, and cell cycle were implicated. Upstream regulators of  cathine and cathinone were found to potentially target several molecules  including interleukin-8, MMP2, PLAU, and micro-RNAs. In conclusion, khat induces  significant cellular and molecular changes that could potentially cause a wide  range of serious diseases and syndromes. Such an impact could have a heavy burden  on the health care system in the countries where khat is consumed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is the third most common malignancy in Saudi Arabia, the highest incidence of which is reported from Jazan province. The objective of this  study was to evaluate the association of various locally used substances,  especially shamma, with oral cancer in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was designed and  patient records were scanned for histologically confirmed oral cancer cases.  Forty eight patients who were recently diagnosed with oral cancer were selected  as cases. Two healthy controls were selected for each observed case and they were  matched with age (+/-5 years) gender and location. Use of different forms of  tobacco such as cigarettes, pipe-smoking and shamma (smokeless- tobacco) was  assessed. Khat, a commonly used chewing substance in the community was also  included. Descriptive analysis was first performed followed by multiple logistic  regression (with and without interaction) to derive odds ratios (ORs) and 95\%  confidence interval (CIs). RESULTS: Mean age of the study sample (56\% males and  44\% females) was 65.3 years. Multinomial regression analysis revealed that shamma  use increased the odds of developing oral cancer by 29 times (OR=29.3;  10.3-83.1). Cigarette (OR=6.74; 2.18-20.8) was also seen to have an effect. With  the interaction model the odds ratio increased significantly for shamma users  (OR=37.2; 12.3-113.2) and cigarette smokers (OR=10.5; 2.88-3.11). Khat was  observed to have negative effect on the disease occurrence when used along with  shamma (OR=0.01; 0.00-0.65). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that shamma, a moist form  of smokeless tobacco is a major threat for oral cancer occurrence in the Jazan  region of Saudi Arabia. This study gives a direction to conduct further  longitudinal studies in the region with increased sample size representing the  population in order to provide more substantial evidence.},

The aim of the present study was to review the current literature  regarding khat use and its association with oral and dental diseases, with  particular emphasis on its link with oral keratotic white lesions and oral  cancer. We searched the literature to identify all relevant articles. Studies  showed that khat is associated with several oral and dental conditions, including  keratotic white lesions, mucosal pigmentation, periodontal disease, tooth loss,  plasma cell stomatitis, and xerostomia. There are limited data on the incidence  of dental caries among khat chewers. The evidence that khat chewing is a risk  factor for oral cancer is still weak, and is mainly based on anecdotal case  reports and uncontrolled studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with a high prevalence reported in Jazan province of Saudi Arabia. The objectives of this  study were to check individual and integrated effects of potential risk factors  for oral squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods: A case control study was  designed with a sample of 210 subjects, in which histopathologically confirmed  incident cases (n=70) and controls (n=140) matched for age, gender and referral  route, were recruited. Differences in exposure to potential risk factors between  cases and controls were assessed using chi-square and McNemar analyses. A  logistic regression model with interactions was applied to check individual and  integrated effects. Results: Mean age of the sample was 55 years (+ 20 years).  Shammah (O.R = 33.01; C.I = 3.22 – 39.88), shisha (O.R = 3.96; C.I = 0.24 –  63.38), and cigarette (O.R = 1.58; C.I = 0.13, 2.50) consumption was  significantly associated (P{\textless}0.05) with oral squamous cell carcinoma development.  In contrast, Khat chewing (O.R = 0.67; C.I = 0.19-2.36) was without significant  effect. An increase in odds ratios was observed when combinations of shammah and  shisha (O.R = 35.03; C.I = 11.50-65.66), shisha and cigarettes (O.R = 10.52; C.I  = 1.03 – 33.90) or shamma and cigarettes (O.R = 10.10; C.I = 0.50 - 20.40) were  used. Conclusion: Combined exposure to risk-factors has serious implications and  policies on oral cancer prevention should be designed with attention to this  aspect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Khat leaves contain the alkaloid cathinone. Research shows that khat might provoke toxicity, mutagenicity, as well as carcinogenicity. METHODS: Two  groups were identified as khat abusers and were categorized by abuse time and  diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Here, 41 participants from  Group 2 were short-term khat users, and 42 participants were long-term khat  users. The control group included 30 healthy individuals. The coding exons  included nine cancer-related genes and were analysed. The histopathological  research was conducted with H\&E staining along with the TP53 protein expression  by implementing immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Here, 41 short-term khat  users carried seven somatic mutations in four out of nine cancer-related genes:  29/41(70.73\%) ARID1A, 24/41(58.53\%) MLH1, 34/41(82.92\%) PIK3CA and 36/41(87.80\%)  TP53. The 42 long-term khat users incorporated nine somatic mutations in five out  of nin ecancer-related genes: 40/42(95.23\%) ARID1A, 36/42(85.71\%) ARID2,  29/42(69.04\%) PIK3CA, 27/42(64.28\%) MLH1, and 35/42(83.33\%) TP53. Every khat user  had somatic mutations related to OSCC affecting the gingiva and the lower lip.  TP53 protein expression was confirmed in all immunohistochemical oral tests.  Carcinoma was also positive in the histopathological analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Khat  is a mutagenic and carcinogenic plant that provoked OSCC among short-term khat  users ({\textless}15 years of use) and long-term users ({\textgreater}15 years of use).},

This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the possible psychosocial  determinants of Shammah consumption among adult Shammah users in Jazan region.  METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted by means of one-on-one interviews  among thirty adult Shammah users. Participants were recruited by means of a  purposive sampling technique. Data were collected using a semi-structured  interview guide utilizing face-to-face and phone-call interviews. Thematic  analysis with hybrid approach was used to analyze the dataset. RESULTS:  Twenty-four sub-codes within four overarching themes were generated. Participants  revealed uncertainty related to Shammah composition, how to quit knowledge and  Shammah prevention/cessation programs. Shammah use identified as a normal  phenomenon in society. Its use was frequently reported in participants' close  network but most users faced family and peers' disapproval. Some users expressed  joy, happiness and focused when using Shammah. Others were disgusted or neutral.  Many users believed Shammah causes cancer and tears oral tissues. Others believed  it relieves toothache or has no effect. Majority of users were confident to quit  and recalled some quitting aids. Toothache, craving, drinking tea and chewing  Khat (leaves of Catha edulis plant that causes moderate euphoria) perceived to be  triggers to use Shammah. Availability of Shammah, withdrawal symptoms, stress,  lack of support, seeing others using Shammah, losing part of routine and  toothache were barriers to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Shammah use was associated with  uncertainty about Shammah composition and quitting knowledge, social  acceptability, influence from family/friends, a range of positive and negative  attitudinal beliefs toward its use and high quitting efficacy beliefs. Future  interventions targeting Shammah should address the acknowledged triggers and  barriers in the present study including the dual use of Shammah and Khat.},

In this study, we established a comprehensive prognostic system covering multiple signatures to elevate the predictive accuracy for overall survival (OS) of hepatitis B virus carriers with HCC development. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and multivariate COX analysis, along with a suite of other online analyses were successfully applied to filtrate a three-gene signature model (

Afterward, the gene-based risk score was calculated based on the Cox coefficient of the individual gene, and the prognostic power was assessed by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (tROC) and Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival analysis. Furthermore, the predictive power of the nomogram, integrated with the risk score and clinical parameters (age at diagnosis and TNM stage), was revealed by the calibration plot and tROC curves, which was verified in the validation set. Taken together, our study may be more effective in guiding the clinical decision-making of personalized treatment for HBV carriers.},

Collectively, these impede the conventional use of deep learning. For the clinical translation of deep learning solutions to become a reality, these challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we review work on the interdisciplinary attempt of training deep neural networks using whole slide images, and highlight the different ideas underlying these methodologies.},

Early detection is crucial towards improving survival in patients diagnosed with oral cancer. Non-invasive strategies equivalent to histology diagnosis are extremely valuable in oral cancer screening and early detection in resource-constrained settings. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), an optical biopsy technique enables real-time imaging with periodic surveillance and capability to image architectural features of the tissues. We report that while OCT system delineates oral pre-cancer and cancer with more than 90\% sensitivity, integration, with artificial neural network-based analysis efficiently identifies high-risk, oral pre-cancer (83\%). This study provides evidence that the robust, low-cost system was effective as a point-of-care device in resource-constrained settings. The high accuracy and portability signify widespread clinical application in oral cancer screening and/or surveillance.

Abstract
Non-invasive strategies that can identify oral malignant and dysplastic oral potentially-malignant lesions (OPML) are necessary in cancer screening and long-term surveillance. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be a rapid, real time and non-invasive imaging method for frequent patient surveillance. Here, we report the validation of a portable, robust OCT device in 232 patients (lesions: 347) in different clinical settings. The device deployed with algorithm-based automated diagnosis, showed efficacy in delineation of oral benign and normal (n = 151), OPML (n = 121), and malignant lesions (n = 75) in community and tertiary care settings. This study showed that OCT images analyzed by automated image processing algorithm could distinguish the dysplastic-OPML and malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 95\% and 93\%, respectively. Furthermore, we explored the ability of multiple (n = 14) artificial neural network (ANN) based feature extraction techniques for delineation high grade-OPML (moderate/severe dysplasia). The support vector machine (SVM) model built over ANN, delineated high-grade dysplasia with sensitivity of 83\%, which in turn, can be employed to triage patients for tertiary care. The study provides evidence towards the utility of the robust and low-cost OCT instrument as a point-of-care device in resource-constrained settings and the potential clinical application of device in screening and surveillance of oral cancer.},

To take advantage of the diagnostic potential of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in contemporary dental prevention and treatment, an intraorally applicable spectral-domain OCT probe has been developed based on an OCT hand-held scanner equipped with a rigid 90°-optics endoscope. The probe was verified in vitro. In vivo, all tooth surfaces could be imaged with the OCT probe, except the vestibular surfaces of third molars and the proximal surface sections of molars within a "blind spot" at a distance greater than 2.5 mm from the tooth surface. Proximal surfaces of 64 posterior teeth of four volunteers were assessed by intraoral OCT, visual-tactile inspection, bitewing radiography and fiber-optic transillumination. The agreement in detecting healthy and carious surfaces varied greatly between OCT and established methods (18.2–94.7\%), whereby the established methods could always be supplemented by OCT. Direct and indirect composite and ceramic restorations with inherent imperfections and failures of the tooth-restoration bond were imaged and qualitatively evaluated. The intraoral OCT probe proved to be a powerful technological approach for the non-invasive imaging of healthy and carious hard tooth tissues and gingiva as well as tooth-colored restorations.},

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive technique based on optical imaging with a micrometre resolution. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential role of OCT in evaluating oral mucosa bullous diseases.

Methods:
two patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) and one patient with pemphigus vulgaris (PV) were examined and images of their oral lesions were performed using OCT.

Results:
In OCT images, the BP blister has a clearly different morphology from the PV one compared to the blistering level.

Conclusion:
This exploratory study suggests that the OCT is able to distinguish epithelial and subepithelial layer in vivo images of healthy oral mucosa from those with bullous diseases, assisting the clinicians in differential diagnosis.The presented data are in accordance with the scientific literature, although a wider pool of cases is needed to increase statistical power. Histological examination and immunofluorescence methods remain the gold standard for the diagnosis of oral bullous diseases. In this context, the OCT can provide the clinician with a valuable aid both as an additional diagnostic tool and in the follow up of the disease.},

In this paper, we present a novel probe that combines an all-fiber optical design with a light-weight magnetic scanning mechanism to provide easy access to the oral cavity. The resulting probe is approximately the size of a pen (10 mm × 140 mm) and weighs only 10 grams. To demonstrate the feasibility and high image quality achieved with the probe, imaging was performed on the buccal mucosa and alveolar mucosa during routine clinical assessment of six patients diagnosed with oral lichen planus. Results show the loss of normal tissue structure within the lesion, and contrast this with the clear delineation of tissue layers in adjacent inconspicuous regions. The results also demonstrate the ability of the probe to acquire a three-dimensional data volume by manually sweeping across the surface of the mucosa.

Early oral cancer diagnosis is an important factor in reducing cancer-associated mortality and morbidity. Traditional oral cancer screening by Conventional Oral Examination (COE) is limited. A new approach in this regard is the use of “optical biopsy systems” like VELscope.

Aims:
Hence, this study aimed to determine the diagnostic value of VELscope, an autofluorescence-based handheld device in detection of dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in general oral potentially malignant disorder.

Settings and Design:
A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in western Maharashtra, India.

Materials and Methods:
Thirty patients with presence of clinically suspicious oral lesions were included, and for each lesion, both the COE and Autofluorescence Examination by VELscope were carried out at the same appointment by different experts. All lesions were biopsied and histopathological findings were documented and analyzed.

Statistical Analysis Used:
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were estimated to determine the accuracy of VELscope examination analysis outcome.

Results:
The study included a total of 30 subjects including 19 (63.33\%) males and 11 (26.66\%) females. Autofluorescence examination by VELscope (AFV) revealed Autofluorescence Loss in 24 (80\%) patients, while 6 (20\%) patients showed Autofluorescence Retained. Comparison between the “high-risk lesions” (moderate/severe dysplasia and OSCC) and “low-risk lesions” (no/mild dysplasia) showed a 90.47\% sensitivity but only 44.44\% specificity.

Conclusions:
The findings of our study indicate that although AFV cannot be a substitute for COE, it can be used as a potential complementary diagnostic aid in surveillance of the high-risk patient population.},

	abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), one of the most common types of cancers worldwide, is diagnosed mainly through tissue biopsy. However, owing to the tumor heterogeneity and other drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy procedure and high cost and limited usefulness of longitudinal surveillance, there has been a focus on adopting more rapid, economical, and noninvasive screening methods. Examples of these include liquid biopsy, optical detection systems, oral brush cytology, microfluidic detection, and artificial intelligence auxiliary diagnosis, which have their own strengths and weaknesses. Extensive research is being performed on various liquid biopsy biomarkers, including novel microbiome components, noncoding RNAs, extracellular vesicles, and circulating tumor DNA. The majority of these elements have demonstrated encouraging clinical outcomes in early OSCC detection. This review summarizes the screening methods for OSCC with a focus on providing new guiding strategies for the diagnosis of the disease.},

	abstract = {Cytopathological examination is one of the main examinations for pleural effusion, and especially for many patients with advanced cancer, pleural effusion is the only accessible specimen for establishing a pathological diagnosis. The lack of cytopathologists and the high cost of gene detection present opportunities for the application of deep learning. In this retrospective analysis, data representing 1321 consecutive cases of pleural effusion were collected. We trained and evaluated our deep learning model based on several tasks, including the diagnosis of benign and malignant pleural effusion, the identiﬁcation of the primary location of common metastatic cancer from pleural effusion, and the prediction of genetic alterations associated with targeted therapy. We achieved good results in identifying benign and malignant pleural effusions (0.932 AUC (area under the ROC curve)) and the primary location of common metastatic cancer (0.910 AUC). In addition, we analyzed ten genes related to targeted therapy in specimens and used them to train the model regarding four alteration statuses, which also yielded reasonable results (0.869 AUC for ALK fusion, 0.804 AUC for KRAS mutation, 0.644 AUC for EGFR mutation and 0.774 AUC for NONE alteration). Our research shows the feasibility and beneﬁts of deep learning to assist in cytopathological diagnosis in clinical settings.},
