## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

For convert ipynb to qmd

https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/reference/convert_ipynb.html

Read a Jupyter/IPython notebook file (`.ipynb`) via
[`jsonlite::fromJSON()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/jsonlite/man/fromJSON.html), convert its code cells to R Markdown code
chunks, preserve Markdown cells, and write out the results to an Rmd file.

```{r}
convert_ipynb(input, output = xfun::with_ext(input, "Rmd"))

```

```{r}

nb_file <- file.choose()
xfun::file_string(nb_file)  # show file content

# convert and write to R Markdown or Quarto qmd
nb_rmd <- rmarkdown:::convert_ipynb(nb_file)
xfun::file_string(nb_rmd)

#rmd_file = tempfile(fileext = '.rmd')
#jsonlite::write_json(nb_rmd, rmd_file, auto_unbox = TRUE, pretty = TRUE)


```
